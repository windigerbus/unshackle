```shell
git clone https://github.com/unshackle-dl/unshackle.git
cd unshackle
uv sync
uv run unshackle --help
```

### Install unshackle as a global (per-user) tool

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/unshackle-dl/unshackle.git
# Then run:
uvx unshackle --help   # or just `unshackle` once PATH updated
```

> [!NOTE]
> After installation, you may need to add the installation path to your PATH environment variable if prompted.
>
> **Recommended:** Use `uv run unshackle` instead of direct command execution to ensure proper virtual environment activation.

# Check available commands
uv run unshackle --help

# Configure your settings
uv run unshackle cfg --help

# Confirm setup and all dependencies exist
